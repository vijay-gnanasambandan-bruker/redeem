# ReDeeM: Repository for Deep Learning Models for Mass Spectrometry

ReDeeM is a Rust crate designed for implementing deep learning models specifically tailored for mass spectrometry data.
The primary goal of this project is to facilitate the prediction of peptide properties and to develop classifier scoring
models (TDA).

### Usage

The ReDeeM crates are designed to be used as a library in other projects, i.e. in Sage. To use the ReDeeM crates, add
the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
redeem-properties = { git = "https://github.com/singjc/redeem.git", branch = "master" }
redeem-classifiers = { git = "https://github.com/singjc/redeem.git", branch = "master" }
```

**Note**: The ReDeeM crates are still under development and are not yet available on crates.io.

### Current Crates

The ReDeeM project consists of two primary crates:

1. **redeem-properties**:
    - This crate focuses on deep learning models for peptide property prediction. It implements models for predicting
      retention time (RT), ion mobility (IM), and MS2 fragment intensities using the Candle library.
    - The models can be trained, fine-tuned on new data and can be saved in the safetensor format for later use.

    - Current Models

    Model | Name | Architecture | Implemented
       --- | --- | --- | ---
    AlphaPept RT Model | `rt_cnn_lstm` | CNN-LSTM | :heavy_check_mark:
    AlphaPept MS2 Model | `ms2_bert` | Bert | :heavy_check_mark:
    AlphaPept CCS Model | `ccs_cnn_lstm` | CNN-LSTM | :heavy_check_mark:
    RT Model | `rt_tf_lstm` | CNN-Transformer | :heavy_check_mark:
    CCS Model | `ccs_tf_lstm` | CNN-Transformer | :heavy_check_mark:

2. **redeem-classifiers**:
    - This crate is aimed at developing semi-supervised scoring classifier models. The goal is to create models for
      separating target peptides from decoys.

    - Current Models

    Model | Name | Architecture | Implemented
       --- | --- | --- | ---
    XGBoost Classifier | `redeem_classifiers::XGBoostClassifier` | XGBoost | :heavy_check_mark:
    GBDT Classifier | `redeem_classifiers::GBDTClassifier` | GBDT | :heavy_check_mark:
    SVM Classifier | `redeem_classifiers::SVMClassifier` | SVM | :heavy_check_mark:

> [!NOTE]
> To use the XGBoost classifier, or the SVM classifier, you need to compile with the `--features xgboost` or
`--features linfa` flag respectively.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The XGBoost crate is a wrapper around the original XGBoost library, which requires clang/c++ to be installed on the
> system. On Ubuntu, you can do the following:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential
    sudo apt install clang
    sudo apt install libstdc++-12-dev
    ```
